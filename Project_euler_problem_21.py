#The goal of this program is to print the sum of all amicable numbers under 10k
#This program can be made more easier if one uses theorems to generate the 
# amicable numbers, two of the methods are ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra theorem and 
# Euler's rule
# both of the methods can be found on wikipedia, which is exactly where I read 
# about these methods
# but since both those methods are very complex I won't be using them but instead 
# I will be using a more simple strategy
